# Knowble App Authentication Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented authentication for the Knowble app using:

1. **React Context API** for state management
2. **Expo Router** for navigation
3. **AsyncStorage** for token persistence
4. **Axios** for API requests

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Context

The authentication context (`AuthContext.tsx`) provides:
- User state management
- Login/register functions
- Token storage and retrieval
- Logout functionality

### API Integration

The API integration (`api.ts`) includes:
- API client setup with Axios
- Authentication endpoints (login, register, refresh)
- Token management in requests
- Error handling

### Authentication Screens

1. **Login Screen**:
   - Email/password form
   - Form validation
   - Error handling
   - Navigation to register

2. **Register Screen**:
   - User registration form
   - Password validation
   - Error handling
   - Navigation to login

### Navigation Flow

The navigation is structured to:
- Check authentication state on app start
- Redirect to appropriate screens based on auth state
- Protect routes that require authentication

## Known Issues

There are some TypeScript errors related to navigation paths that need to be fixed. See the README in the `(auth)` folder for details.

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors in navigation
2. Add logout functionality in the main app
3. Implement token refresh mechanism
4. Add password reset functionality
5. Add profile management
6. Update API URL for production deployment 
 
##Absolutely! Here’s a clear list of all the features from your Django-based MicroLearn web application (as described in `microlearn_web_application.md`) that should be implemented in your Knowble App frontend (React Native/Expo). I’ll group them by category and note which ones are already mentioned in your navigation structure or README, and which are new.
