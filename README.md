## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow
- The app uses **file-based routing** (see the `app/` directory).
- Main screens and features are organized into folders:
  - `(auth)`: Authentication (login, register, etc.)
  - `(drawer)`: Drawer navigation (profile, settings, saved, etc.)
  - `(tabs)`: Tab navigation (home, categories, search, subscriptions, etc.)
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `VideoCard`, `NotificationProvider`)
- To add a new screen, create a new file or folder in the appropriate section of `app/`.
- For shared logic or UI, add to `components/`.
- **Development:**
  - Make a new branch for your feature or fix.
  - Commit your changes with clear messages.
  - Open a Pull Request (PR) for review.
  - Follow code style and naming conventions.
